____________________________________To perform real-time network traffic analysis and data packet logging using Snort, follow these structured sections:


---

🔍 Aim:

To analyze real-time network traffic and log packets using Snort, an open-source Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS), for monitoring suspicious activities in a network environment.


---

🧠 Algorithm:

1. Install Snort on your system.


2. Configure Snort with necessary rules and interfaces.


3. Start Snort in packet logging mode to capture real-time traffic.


4. Analyze log files to review packet-level data.


5. Refine rules based on traffic behavior.


6. Repeat analysis for continuous monitoring and detection.

🛠️ Procedure:

Step 1: Installation

sudo apt update
sudo apt install snort

During installation, specify the home network IP range.


Step 2: Verify Installation

snort -V

Step 3: Configuration

Configuration files are usually in /etc/snort/.

Open and edit the snort.conf file to define:

var HOME_NET 192.168.1.0/24
var EXTERNAL_NET any


Step 4: Create Log Directory

sudo mkdir /var/log/snort
sudo chmod 777 /var/log/snort

Step 5: Run Snort in Packet Logging Mode

sudo snort -dev -i eth0 -l /var/log/snort -A console

-d: Dump the application layer data.

-e: Show link layer headers.

-v: Verbose mode.

-i eth0: Interface to listen on (change if needed).

-l: Directory to save logs.


Step 6: Observe and Analyze Logs

Logs will be stored in /var/log/snort/

Use tools like tcpdump, wireshark, or read Snort logs directly.


Step 7: Add Custom Rules (Optional)

Edit local.rules to add detection rules, e.g.:

alert tcp any any -> 192.168.1.0/24 80 (msg:"HTTP Access Detected"; sid:1000001;)

Reload Snort with:

sudo snort -A console -q -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0


---

💻 Execution (Example Command):

sudo snort -dev -i eth0 -l /var/log/snort -A console

Sample Output:

05/30-14:12:50.191234 192.168.1.2:3456 -> 93.184.216.34:80
TCP TTL:64 TOS:0x0 ID:1111 IpLen:20 DgmLen:52
***A**** Seq: 0x1  Ack: 0x2  Win: 0x3  TcpLen: 32


---

📦 Output:

Packets are logged in /var/log/snort/.

Console shows live traffic alerts and packet summaries.

Logged files (e.g., snort.log.*) contain binary packet dumps for analysis.



---

📊 Result:

Snort successfully captured real-time network traffic and logged the data packets for later analysis. The logs can now be inspected to detect any malicious patterns or rule violations, helping in proactive network defense.

Let me know if you want a sample custom rule, Wireshark-compatible log, or steps for running Snort in IDS mode.
